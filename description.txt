Built for tModLoader Alpha 1.4-preview.
If you use 1.4-stable and have issues, you know why.

<<THIS IS NOT THE MOD OF REDEMPTION!!>>
The actual Redemption mod is not currently available through the mod browser, but you can acquire it in its current work-in-progress state by checking Discord.
For Steam, here's your link: https://discord.gg/J25aSxCadz
In-game, please click the Homepage button down below.

This is a small mod containing just a few items:
1) various vanity parts, mostly Xenomite-based,
2) a "Xenomite Crystal Bomb" weapon
(damage, DoTs, and projectile-reflecting crystal pillars)
3) a "Xenomite Buster" weapon
(damage, DoTs, chargeable, based on Mega Man X)

The weapons can be upgraded as you progress.
With Redemption, they apply Redemption's Xenomite debuffs.
Without, they apply Poisoned, with a chance of Cursed Flames.


This was created mainly for myself, but I hope you like it.

The weapon image is a PlayerDrawLayer and is slightly out of alignment when gravity is flipped. I'm not exactly sure how I can fix that...
