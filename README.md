# DeviantAnomalyRedemptionStuff
made for 1.4 Alpha-Preview

This started as a personal 1.3 thing, consisting of my vanity set, some weapons I wanted to see, and a variant of 1.3 Redemption's Infected Core, but then I screwed up and lost the source files, and it seemed like that was as good a time as any to move on to 1.4. I've recreated the vanity set and the "Xenomite Crystal Bomb" weapon, and... intend to eventually recreate the claw and arm cannon I made, but I'd like to see what might result if this wasn't just my work. What if the rest of the Redemption community into it? What things would they think up?

Basically, I want to see this become a community project, full of any and all sorts of ideas, be it vanity, weapons, armor, accessories, other items, pets, enemies, bosses, etc., though keep in mind, these ideas don't have to be Redemption-related, and the mod will work on its own, while sometimes making use of Redemption things when it's enabled, like debuffs and such.

I'm not a professional coder here, so it'll come along slowly, but I think this could become something awesome with all of us together.

Naturally I'll be in the Redemption mod's Discord:

Come over if you're interested in any of this.
